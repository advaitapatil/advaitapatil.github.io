I am a medical student at [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/). I previously studied at [Stanford University](https://cs.stanford.edu/), where I received an MS in Computer Science (AI track) and bachelor’s degrees in Computer Science and Biology.

My broad interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence and healthcare, particularly with respect to development, clinical deployment, and evaluation of machine learning algorithms. I’ve spent time innovating new computational & biomedical systems at [Mass General Brigham](https://www.massgeneral.org/neurosurgery), Stanford [ChEM-H](https://chemh.stanford.edu/) & [Bioengineering](https://bioengineering.stanford.edu/), [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/space-science-and-astrobiology-at-ames/), [Stanford Health Care](https://med.stanford.edu/gensurg.html), [MIT](https://cheme.mit.edu/), and [UCSF](https://bts.ucsf.edu/).

When not at the bench, computer, or hospital, I enjoy capturing and reflecting on our world's natural wonders through [nature photography and poetry](http://naturephotopoetry.wordpress.com).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
